/**
 * Game Logic and Mechanics Module
 * 
 * Welcome to the brain of our shape-matching game! This module contains all the
 * core logic that makes the game actually work. If the rendering module is the
 * artist, this module is the game designer - it knows all the rules, manages
 * the difficulty progression, and orchestrates the entire gameplay experience.
 * 
 * This module handles some pretty complex stuff:
 * - Intelligent shape generation that ensures winnable puzzles
 * - Difficulty scaling that keeps players engaged without frustrating them
 * - Smooth animations and feedback systems
 * - Score tracking and high score management
 * - Timer management for different game modes
 * 
 * The shape generation algorithm is particularly sophisticated - it uses grid-based
 * positioning to ensure shapes are well-distributed, guarantees at least one
 * correct match is always present, and balances the challenge appropriately for
 * each difficulty level.

/**
 * Gets the available shapes for the current difficulty level.
 * 
 * This function is like a curator deciding which shapes to include in an art
 * exhibition. It starts with the basic shapes that everyone should know, then
 * adds more complex shapes as the difficulty increases.
 * 
 * The progression is carefully designed:
 * - Easy: Just the basics (circle, square, triangle, rectangle)
 * - Medium: Adds intermediate shapes (pentagon, hexagon, oval, diamond)
 * - Hard: Includes challenging shapes (octagon, star, heart, trapezoid)
 * 
 * This gradual progression helps players build their shape recognition skills
 * without being overwhelmed by too many options at once.
 * 
 * @example
 * // In easy mode
 * gameState.currentDifficulty = 'easy';
 * const shapes = getAvailableShapes(); // ['circle', 'square', 'triangle', 'rectangle']
 * 
 * // In hard mode
 * gameState.currentDifficulty = 'hard';
 * const shapes = getAvailableShapes(); // All 12 shape types
 * 
 * @function
 * @returns {string[]} Array of shape names available for current difficulty

/**
 * Applies difficulty-specific settings to the current game session.
 * 
 * This function is like a game director adjusting all the stage settings before
 * a performance. It takes the current difficulty level and makes sure all the
 * game parameters are set correctly.
 * 
 * Key adjustments made:
 * - Shape count: Ensures the player's preference is within difficulty limits
 * - UI updates: Changes the instruction text to explain matching rules
 * - Display updates: Shows the current shape quantity setting
 * 
 * The function respects player preferences when possible - if someone wants
 * 10 shapes in easy mode but the limit is 8, we cap it at 8. But if they
 * want 6 shapes and the minimum is 4, we keep their preference.
 * 
 * @example
 * // Player selects hard difficulty
 * gameState.currentDifficulty = 'hard';
 * gameState.shapesQuantity = 25; // Player wants lots of shapes
 * applyDifficultySettings();
 * // shapesQuantity is now capped at 18 (hard mode maximum)
 * // UI now shows "Find this shape: (Shape AND Color)"
 * 
 * @function
 * @returns {void}

/**
 * Generates a set of randomly positioned shapes for the game board.
 * 
 * This is one of the most complex and important functions in our entire game!
 * It's responsible for creating puzzles that are challenging but always solvable.
 * Think of it as a puzzle designer that needs to balance randomness with fairness.
 * 
 * The function performs several sophisticated tasks:
 * 
 * 1. **Responsive Sizing**: Adjusts shape sizes based on screen size so the game
 *    feels natural on any device from phones to large monitors.
 * 
 * 2. **Grid-Based Positioning**: Uses an intelligent grid system to distribute
 *    shapes evenly across the screen, preventing clustering and ensuring all
 *    shapes are visible and clickable.
 * 
 * 3. **Guaranteed Solution**: Always ensures at least one correct match exists,
 *    with smart placement to avoid making it too obvious or too hidden.
 * 
 * 4. **Difficulty-Appropriate Challenge**: Adjusts color schemes, shape variety,
 *    and positioning complexity based on the selected difficulty level.
 * 
 * 5. **Visual Balance**: Manages z-index layering so matching shapes tend to be
 *    visible while still maintaining visual interest through overlapping.
 * 
 * The algorithm is designed to be robust - it handles edge cases like small screens,
 * unusual target shapes, and ensures the game remains playable even when things
 * go wrong (like running out of grid positions).
 * 
 * @example
 * // Generate 10 shapes with 'circle' as the target
 * generateGameShapes(10, 'circle');
 * // Now gameState.shapes contains 10 shape objects with guaranteed circle match
 * 
 * // Generate shapes for current difficulty and quantity settings
 * generateGameShapes(gameState.shapesQuantity, gameState.targetShape);
 * 
 * @function
 * @param {number} count - Number of shapes to generate (will be adjusted for screen size)
 * @param {string} targetShapeType - The shape type that players need to find
 * @returns {void} Populates gameState.shapes array and renders shapes on board
 * @throws {Error} If count is not a positive number or targetShapeType is invalid
