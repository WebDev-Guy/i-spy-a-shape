## üîç Overview

The Shape Identification Game is a web-based educational game designed to help children recognize and identify various geometric shapes. With multiple difficulty levels and game modes, it offers an engaging way for kids to learn shape recognition through interactive gameplay.

Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, this game runs entirely in the browser without requiring a server or external dependencies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Configuration

You can customize various game behaviors by modifying the configuration values in the `js/game.js` file. Here's a breakdown of the available configuration options:

### Basic Configuration

| Config Property | Description | Default Value |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| `maxShapes` | Maximum number of shapes to display at once | 10 |
| `minShapes` | Minimum number of shapes to display | 5 |
| `maxAttempts` | Number of attempts allowed before game over | 3 |
| `successDelay` | Delay in milliseconds before showing new shapes after a successful match | 800 |
| `mode` | Default game mode ('classic' or 'timed') | 'classic' |

### Shape Settings

The game includes different sets of shapes based on difficulty level:

- `basicShapes`: Shapes available in all difficulty levels (circle, square, triangle, rectangle)
- `mediumShapes`: Additional shapes in medium and hard difficulties (pentagon, hexagon, oval, diamond)
- `hardShapes`: Shapes only available in hard difficulty (octagon, star, heart, trapezoid)

### Color Settings

The game uses a WCAG compliant color palette stored in the `colors` array. You can modify these colors to create custom themes while maintaining accessibility standards.

### Difficulty Settings

Each difficulty level has customizable parameters:

#### Easy Mode
```javascript
easy: {
    shapesCount: { min: 4, max: 8 },     // Range of shapes to display
    timeLimit: 90,                        // Time limit in seconds (for timed mode)
    timeBonus: { correct: 5, colorMatch: 8 }, // Time added for correct answers
    timePenalty: 3,                       // Time deducted for wrong answers
    distinctColors: true,                 // Whether shapes have unique colors
    rotationRange: { min: 0, max: 45 },   // Shape rotation angles
    movementSpeed: { min: 0, max: 0 }     // No movement in easy mode
}
```

#### Medium Mode
```javascript
medium: {
    shapesCount: { min: 6, max: 12 },
    timeLimit: 60,
    timeBonus: { correct: 3, colorMatch: 5 },
    timePenalty: 5,
    distinctColors: false,
    rotationRange: { min: 0, max: 180 },
    movementSpeed: { min: 0, max: 0 }     // No movement in medium mode
}
```

#### Hard Mode
```javascript
hard: {
    shapesCount: { min: 10, max: 18 },
    timeLimit: 45,
    timeBonus: { correct: 2, colorMatch: 3 },
    timePenalty: 7,
    distinctColors: false,
    rotationRange: { min: 0, max: 359 },
    movementSpeed: { min: 0.05, max: 0.25 } // Shapes move in hard mode
}
```

### Visual Effects

Confetti animation settings can be customized:

```javascript
confetti: {
    particleCount: 100,       // Number of confetti particles
    gravity: 0.2,             // How fast particles fall
    spread: 70,               // How wide particles spread
    colors: ['#FF6B6B', ...], // Particle colors
    velocityFactor: 0.7       // Speed of particle movement
}
```

### How to Modify Configuration

To modify any of these settings:

1. Open the `js/game.js` file in a text editor
2. Locate the `gameConfig` object at the top of the file
3. Change the desired values
4. Save the file and refresh the game in your browser

Example: To make the game easier, you could increase the `maxAttempts` value or extend the time limits in each difficulty level.
